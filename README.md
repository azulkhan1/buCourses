# buCourses

buCourses is a side project that I am currently working on to replace BU's
course search website that is highly outdated and only lets you look at a certain
amount of courses per web page. I am personally frustrated by how slow the load
time of the website is. Also the way the information about courses is organized
is all over the place. This project is being made to remedy this issue and hopefully
help students get a better way of looking up courses to take during upcoming semesters

This project was the 1st project of 3 total projects that build on top of eachother
to reach the desired end goal

Tasks:

- get all the major/course data using python (COMPLETED)
- put all the data into a csv (COMPLETED)

The goals for this project were to get all the course data for a particular major
in this case Computer Science and put all of the data into a csv file.

The results of the project can be viewed in the majorCourses.csv File
