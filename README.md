# BU Courses

BU Courses is a Python-based project aimed at streamlining the course search experience for Boston University students. The primary goal is to gather major/course data from BU and organize it into a user-friendly CSV format. This project serves as a part of a larger initiative, Terrier Search, which seeks to enhance the way students discover and select courses for upcoming semesters.

# Features 

Data Scraping: Utilizes Python scripts to scrape course data from Boston University's course listings.

Data Organization: Efficiently organizes and consolidates course information into a single CSV file for easy access and reference.

Student-Centric Design: Focuses on creating a user-friendly format that simplifies the course selection process for students.

# Motivation

Frustrated by the slow load times and outdated interface of BU's course search website, and the scattered organization of course information, this project is my initiative to address these challenges. It's designed to provide a more efficient and cohesive course search experience for my fellow students.

# Setup and Usage
