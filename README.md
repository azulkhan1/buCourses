# buCourses

buCourses is a side project that I am currently working on to replace BU's
course search website that is highly outdated and only lets you look at a certain
amount of courses per web page. I am personally frustrated by how slow the load
time of the website is. Also the way the information about courses is organized
is all over the place. This project is being made to remedy this issue and hopefully
help students get a better way of looking up courses to take during upcoming semesters

Goals of the project:

- To provide a more user friendly experience for Students looking to take courses in their upcoming semesters
- all courses for a given major can be viewed in a single webpage
- all data is completely organized using notion databases

Tasks:

- get all the major/course data using python
- put all the data into a csv
- use the csv file and transfer the data into a notion database using the notion API
